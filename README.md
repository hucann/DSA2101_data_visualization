# DSA2101 project: Exploring the Relationship Between Fishing Industry and Income Level

## Overview
This repository contains the code and findings of a group project conducted using data from the TidyTuesday repository. The project aimed to explore and visualize real-world data to answer a meaningful question related to the fishing industry and its relationship with income level across different countries.

## Project Details
- **Task**: The task involved selecting one topic, formulating a meaningful question, answering it with three data visualizations using ggplot2, and documenting methods and findings in a write-up.
- **Question**: How does a country’s fishing industry relate to its income level?
- **Hypothesis**: We hypothesized that specific trends exist within the fishing industry that varies according to the income level of the countries. Many interconnected factors pertinent to national income can significantly influence the development and dynamics of specific industries within a nation.
- **Datasets Used**: We used the following datasets:
  - **captured_vs_farmed**: Contains information on trends in fishery production over the years across different income groups.
  - **production**: Provides data on the trends in fish species produced over the years across different income groups.
  - **consumption**: Includes data on the level of fishery consumption across countries categorized by income groups worldwide.
- **Required Libraries**: The following libraries are required for this project:
  - `tidyverse`: Comprehensive collection of data manipulation tools in R.
  - `maps`: Provides functions to draw geographical maps.
  - `RColorBrewer`: Provides color schemes for maps and other graphics.

## Visualizations
1. **Visualisation 1 (Stacked Area Plot)**: Utilized the *captured_vs_farmed* dataset to create a stacked area plot illustrating trends in fishery production over the years across different income groups.
   
2. **Visualisation 2 (100% Stacked Barplot)**: Employed the *production* dataset to create a 100% stacked barplot illustrating trends in fish species produced over the years across different income groups.
   
3. **Visualisation 3 (Bivariate Choropleth Map)**: Utilized the *consumption* dataset to generate a bivariate choropleth map representing the 2017 level of fishery consumption across countries categorized by income groups worldwide.

## Findings
The visualizations illustrate the complex relationship between a country’s fishing industry and its income level:
- Low-income countries face economic and developmental constraints, resulting in consistently low fishery production.
- Limited access to advanced technology and deep-sea resources further exacerbates development constraints, constraining extensive fishing activities and resulting in low consumption.

## Files Included
- **project_final.Rmd**: R markdown file containing code and analysis.
- **project_final.html**: Output in HTML generated by Rmd, showcasing the final results and findings.
